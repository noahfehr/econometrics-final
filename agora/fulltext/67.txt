``(d) Operation and Controls Research and Development.--
The Secretary shall conduct research to develop improvements to the operation and controls of the electric grid, in coordination with industry partners. Such activities shall include--
``(1) a training facility or facilities to allow grid operators to gain operational experience with advanced grid control concepts and technologies;
``(2) development of cost-effective advanced operation and control concepts and technologies, such as adaptive islanding, dynamic line rating systems, power flow controllers, network topology optimization, smart circuit breakers, intelligent load shedding, and fault-tolerant control system architectures;
``(3) development of real-time control concepts using artificial intelligence and machine learning for improved electric grid resilience; and
``(4) utilization of advanced data analytics including load forecasting, power flow modeling, equipment failure prediction, resource optimization, risk analysis, and decision analysis.

``(e) Interoperability Research and Development.--The Secretary shall conduct research and development on tools and technologies that improve the interoperability and compatibility of new and emerging components, technologies, and systems with existing electric grid infrastructure.``(f) Underground Transmission and Distribution Lines.--In carrying out the program under subsection (a), the Secretary shall support research and development on underground transmission and distribution lines. This shall include research on--
``(1) methods for lowering the costs of underground transmission and distribution lines, including through novel installation techniques and materials considerations;
``(2) techniques to improve the lifespan of underground transmission and distribution lines;
(3) wireless sensors to improve safety of underground transmission and distribution lines and to predict, identify, detect, and transmit information about degradation and faults; and(4) methods for improving the resilience and reliability of underground transmission and distribution lines, including technologies and techniques that can mitigate the impact of flooding, storm surge, and seasonal climate cycles on degradation of and damage to underground transmission and distribution lines.
``(g) Grid Architecture and Scenario Development.--
``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary shall establish and facilitate a collaborative process to develop model grid architecture and a set of future scenarios for the electric grid to examine the impacts of different combinations of resources (including different quantities of distributed energy resources and large-scale, central generation) on the electric grid.
``(2) Architecture.--In supporting the development of model grid architectures, the Secretary shall--
``(A) analyze a variety of grid architecture scenarios that range from minor upgrades to existing transmission grid infrastructure to scenarios that involve the replacement of significant portions of existing transmission grid infrastructure;
``(B) analyze the effects of the increasing proliferation of renewable and other zero emissions energy generation sources, increasing use of distributed resources owned by non-utility entities, and the use of digital and automated controls not managed by grid operators;
``(C) include a variety of new and emerging distribution grid technologies, including distributed energy resources, electric vehicle charging stations, distribution automation technologies, energy storage, and renewable energy sources;
``(D) analyze the effects of local load balancing and other forms of decentralized control;
``(E) analyze the effects of changes to grid architectures resulting from modernizing electric grid systems, including communications, controls, markets, consumer choice, emergency response, electrification, and cybersecurity concerns; and
``(F) develop integrated grid architectures that incorporate system resilience for cyber, physical, and communications systems.
``(3) Market structure.--The grid architecture and scenarios developed under paragraph (1) shall, to the extent practicable, account for differences in market structure, including an examination of the potential for stranded costs in each type of market structure.
``(h) Computing Resources and Data Coordination Research and Development.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall--
``(1) leverage existing computing resources at the National Laboratories; and
``(2) develop voluntary standards for data taxonomies and communication protocols in coordination with public and private sector stakeholders.

``(i) Information Sharing.--None of the activities authorized in this section shall require private entities to share information or data with the Secretary.
`(j) Resilience.--In this section, the term resilience' means the ability to withstand and reduce the magnitude or duration of disruptive events, which includes the capability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, or rapidly recover from such an event, including from deliberate attacks, accidents, and naturally occurring threats or incidents.''.
