SEC. 11504. AT-SEA RECOVERY OPERATIONS PILOT PROGRAM.

(a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a pilot program to evaluate the potential use of remotely controlled or autonomous operation and monitoring of certain vessels for the purposes of--
	(1) better understanding the complexities of such at-sea operations and potential risks to navigation safety, vessel security, maritime workers, the public, and the environment;
	(2) gathering observational and performance data from monitoring the use of remotely-controlled or autonomous vessels; and(3) assessing and evaluating regulatory requirements necessary to guide the development of future occurrences of such operations and monitoring activities.

(b) Duration and Effective Date.--The duration of the pilot program established under this section shall be not more than 5 years beginning on the date on which the pilot program is established, which shall be not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
(c) Authorized Activities.--The activities authorized under this section include--
	(1) remote over-the-horizon monitoring operations related to the active at-sea recovery of spaceflight components on an unmanned vessel or platform;
	(2) procedures for the unaccompanied operation and monitoring of an unmanned spaceflight recovery vessel or platform; and
	(3) unmanned vessel transits and testing operations without a physical tow line related to space launch and recovery operations, except within 12 nautical miles of a port.

(d) Interim Authority.--In recognition of potential risks to navigation safety, vessel security, maritime workers, the public, and the environment, and the unique circumstances requiring the use of remotely operated or autonomous vessels, the Secretary, in the pilot program established under subsection (a), may--
	(1) allow remotely controlled or autonomous vessel operations to proceed consistent to the extent practicable under the proposed title 33, United States Code, and 46, United States Code, including navigation and manning laws and regulations;
	(2) modify or waive applicable regulations and guidance as the Secretary considers appropriate to--
		(A) allow remote and autonomous vessel at-sea operations and activities to occur while ensuring navigation safety; and
		(B) ensure the reliable, safe, and secure operation of remotely-controlled or autonomous vessels; and
	(3) require each remotely operated or autonomous vessel to be at all times under the supervision of 1 or more individuals--
		(A) holding a merchant mariner credential which is suitable to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard; and
		(B) who shall practice due regard for the safety of navigation of the autonomous vessel, to include collision avoidance.
(e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to--
	(1) permit foreign vessels to participate in the pilot program established under subsection (a);
	(2) waive or modify applicable laws and regulations under the proposed title 33, United States Code, and title 46, United States Code, except to the extent authorized under subsection (d)(2);
	(3) waive or modify applicable laws and regulations under titles 49 and 51 of the United States Code; or
	(4) waive or modify any regulations arising under international conventions.

(f) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the employment in the coastwise trade of a vessel or platform that does not meet the requirements of sections 12112, 55102, 55103, and 55111 of title 46, United States Code.

(g) Authority Unaffected.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect, impinge, or alter any authority of the Secretary of Transportation under titles 49 and 51, United States Code.
(h) Briefings.--The Secretary or the designee of the Secretary shall brief the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives on the program established under subsection (a) on a quarterly basis.

(i) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the expiration of the pilot program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives a final report regarding an assessment of the execution of the pilot program and implications for maintaining navigation safety, the safety of maritime workers, and the preservation of the environment.
(j) GAO Report.--
	(1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report on the state of autonomous and remote technologies in the operation of shipboard equipment and the safe and secure navigation of vessels in Federal waters of the United States.
	(2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall include the following:
		(A) An assessment of commercially available autonomous and remote technologies in the operation of shipboard equipment and the safe and secure navigation of vessels during the 10 years immediately preceding the date of the report.
		(B) An analysis of the safety, physical security, cybersecurity, and collision avoidance risks and benefits associated with autonomous and remote technologies in the operation of shipboard equipment and the safe and secure navigation of vessels, including environmental considerations.
		(C) An assessment of the impact of such autonomous and remote technologies, and all associated technologies, on labor, including--
			(i) roles for credentialed and noncredentialed workers regarding such autonomous, remote, and associated technologies; and
			(ii) training and workforce development needs associated with such technologies.
		(D) An assessment and evaluation of regulatory requirements necessary to guide the development of future autonomous, remote, and associated technologies in the
operation of shipboard equipment and safe and secure navigation of vessels.
		(E) An assessment of the extent to which such technologies are being used in other countries and how such countries have regulated such technologies.
		(F) Recommendations regarding authorization, infrastructure, and other requirements necessary for the implementation of such technologies in the United States.	(3) Consultation.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, consultation with the maritime industry including--
		(A) vessel operators, including commercial carriers, entities engaged in exploring for, developing, or producing resources, including non-mineral energy resources in its offshore areas, and supporting entities in the maritime industry;
		(B) shipboard personnel impacted by any change to autonomous vessel operations, in order to assess the various benefits and risks associated with the implementation of autonomous, remote, and associated technologies in the operation of shipboard equipment and safe and secure navigation of vessels and the impact such technologies would have on maritime jobs and maritime manpower;
		(C) relevant federally funded research institutions, non-governmental organizations, and academia; and
		(D) the commercial space industry.

(k) Merchant Mariner Credential Defined.--In this section, the term ``merchant mariner credential'' means a merchant mariner license, certificate, or document that the Secretary is authorized to issue pursuant to title 46, United States Code.
