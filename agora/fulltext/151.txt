(3) an examination of whether international standards for select emerging technologies are being designed to promote interests of the People’s Republic of China that are expressed in the ‘‘Made in China 2025’’ plan to the exclusion of other participants; 
(4) an examination of how the previous practices that the People’s Republic of China has used while participating in international standards setting organizations may foretell how the People’s Republic of China is likely to engage in international standardization activities of critical technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum information science, and what may be the consequences; 
(5) recommendations on how the United States can take steps to mitigate the influence of the People’s Republic of China and bolster United States public and private sector participation in international standards-setting bodies; and 
(6) any other area the Director, in consultation with the entity selected to conduct the study, determines is important to address. 
(b) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—The agreement entered into under subsection (a) shall provide that, not later than two years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the entity conducting the study shall—
