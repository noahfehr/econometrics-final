SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Consumer Literacy and Empowerment to Advance Responsible Navigation of Artificial Intelligence Act” or the “Consumers LEARN AI Act”.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Artificial intelligence is being incorporated into progressively more products and services that affect the lives of individuals across the United States every day.
(2) Artificial intelligence technology has the potential to benefit consumers—
(A) in terms of increased efficiency;
(B) in areas such as automation, personalized learning, entertainment, problem solving, and more; and
(C) with respect to future advances yet to be invented.
(3) Consumers require new skill sets and guidance on best practices to make effective use of artificial intelligence products and services. A lack of familiarity with new technology can create barriers to its adoption and trust. An understanding of the strengths and limitations of artificial intelligence technologies can enable consumers to make informed decisions about when and where to employ artificial intelligence products and services.
(4) Consumer education can supplement, although not replace, the responsibility of developers and deployers of artificial intelligence products and services to ensure their safety and efficacy and to provide product-specific consumer guidance about recommended uses as well as inappropriate or unsafe uses.SEC. 3.
