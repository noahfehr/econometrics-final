TITLE III--NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE
Subtitle A--Preliminary Matters

SEC. 10301. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

It is the sense of Congress that--
	(1) the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and its National Laboratories, and other key Federal agencies have carried out vital work supporting basic and applied research to create knowledge that is a key driver of the economy of the United States and a critical component of national security;
	(2) openness to diverse perspectives and a focus on freedom from censorship and political bias will continue to make educational and research institutions in the United States beacons to thousands of students from across the world;
	(3) increasing research and technology transfer investments, building regional capacity and reducing geographic disparity, strengthening supply chains, and increasing capabilities in key technology focus areas will enhance the competitive advantage and leadership of the United States in the global economy;
	(4) the Federal Government must utilize the full talent and potential of the entire Nation by avoiding undue geographic concentration of research and STEM education funding, encouraging broader participation of populations underrepresented in STEM, and collaborating with nongovernment partners to ensure the leadership of the United States in technological innovation; and
	(5) authorization and funding for investments in research, education, technology transfer, intellectual property, manufacturing, and other core strengths of the United States innovation ecosystem, including at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, should be done on a bipartisan basis.

	(4) The 305-meter radio telescope made unparalleled contributions to the fields of radio astronomy, planetary, and atmospheric sciences, and played a role in inspiring thousands of students in Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world to pursue careers in STEM fields through the Arecibo Observatory Education and Public Outreach Programs.
	(5) The radio telescope significantly advanced the field of radio astronomy, including the first indirect detection of gravitational waves, the first detection of extrasolar planets, innumerable contributions to the field of time domain astronomy and the study of the interstellar medium, and played a key role in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
	(6) The Arecibo Observatory had the best planetary radar system in the world, used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for near-Earth object detection and was an essential part of the agency's planetary defense program.
	(7) The planetary radar at the Arecibo Observatory has contributed fundamentally and significantly to the knowledge of the solar system.
