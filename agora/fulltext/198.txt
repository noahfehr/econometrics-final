generation computing models, materials, devices, architectures, and algorithms to enable the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
	(2) Efforts to--
		(A) overcome challenges with engineering and applied research of microelectronics, including with respect to the physical limits on transistors, electrical interconnects, and memory elements;
		(B) promote long-term advancements in computing technologies, including by fostering a unified and multidisciplinary approach encompassing research and development into--
			(i) next-generation algorithm design;
			(ii) next-generation compute capability;
			(iii) generative and adaptive artificial intelligence for design applications;
			(iv) photonics-based microprocessors, including electrophotonics;
			(v) the chemistry and physics of new materials;
(vi) optical communication networks, including electrophotonics; and
(vii) safety and controls for generative artificial intelligence applications for the intelligence community.
	(3) Any other activity the Director determines would promote the development of microelectronics research for future technologies, including optical communications or quantum technologies.
(c) Consideration, Consultation, and Collaboration.--In carrying out the program established under subsection (a), the Director of National Intelligence shall--
	(1) consider the national strategy developed pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(A)(i) of section 9906 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (15 U.S.C. 4656);
	(2) consult with the Secretary of Commerce; and
	(3) actively collaborate with relevant Government agencies and programs, including the programs established under subsection (c), (d), (e), and (f) of such section 9906 (15 U.S.C. 4656), academic institutions, and private industry to leverage expertise and resources in conducting research.
(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated for the National Intelligence Program of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence may be made available to carry out the program established under subsection (a).
(e) Briefing Requirements.--The Director of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity shall provide to the congressional intelligence committees, the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and, consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and methods, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, regular briefings on--
	(1) the progress, achievements, and outcomes of the program established under subsection (a);
	(2) the collaborations conducted pursuant to subsection (c); and(3) recommendations for future research priorities.
