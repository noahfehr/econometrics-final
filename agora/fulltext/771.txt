About this release 
 
When we embarked on our effort to operationalize Microsoftﾕs six AI principles, we knew there was a policy gap. Laws and norms had not caught up with AIﾕs unique risks or societyﾕs needs. Yet, our product development teams needed concrete and actionable guidance as to what our principles meant and how they could uphold them. We leveraged the expertise on our research, policy, and engineering teams to develop guidance on how to fill that gap. 
 
The Responsible AI Standard is the product of a multi-year effort to define product development requirements for responsible AI.  We are making available this second version of the Responsible AI Standard to share what we have learned, invite feedback from others, and contribute to the discussion about building better norms and practices around AI. 
 
While our Standard is an important step in Microsoftﾕs responsible AI journey, it is just one step. As we make progress with implementation, we expect to encounter challenges that require us to pause, reflect, and adjust. Our Standard will remain a living document, evolving to address new research, technologies, laws, and learnings from within and outside the company.  
 
There is a rich and active global dialog about how to create principled and actionable norms to ensure organizations develop and deploy AI responsibly. We have benefited from this discussion and will continue to contribute to it. We believe that industry, academia, civil society, and government need to collaborate to advance the state-of-the-art and learn from one another. Together, we need to answer open research questions, close measurement gaps, and design new practices, patterns, resources, and tools. 
 
As we continue our journey, we welcome feedback on our approach and insights on other ways forward:

A1.2 Review the completed Impact Assessment with the reviewers identified according to your organizationﾕs compliance process before development starts. Secure all required approvals from those reviewers. Tags: Impact Assessment. 
A1.3 Update and review the Impact Assessment at least annually, when new intended uses are added, and before advancing to a new release stage. Tags: Impact Assessment. 
 Goal A2: Oversight of significant adverse impacts 

Microsoft AI systems are reviewed to identify systems that may have a significant adverse impact on people, organizations, and society, and additional oversight and requirements are applied to those systems.   
Applies to: All AI systems.
Requirements

RS3.3 When new uses, critical operational factors, or changes in the supported range of an operational factor are identified, determine whether any new use or operational factor can be supported with the existing system, will be supported but require additional work, or will not be supported.  
･ When new uses or operational factors identified are to be supported, evaluate the updated system in accordance with requirement RS1.6, add the new intended use to the Impact Assessment, and publish updated communication in accordance with requirement RS1.9. 
･ When these new uses or operational factor range changes cannot or will not be accommodated to ensure reliable and safe performance of the system update customer documentation described in RS1.9 to include the new use as an unsupported use. 
When the system is a platform service made available to external customers or partners, include this information in the required Transparency Note.

RS3.4 When a system is to be used for a Sensitive Use that imposes qualification or quality control requirements beyond the intended uses and/or operational factor ranges, conduct an evaluation specific to this use. If the required Responsible Release Criteria cannot be met, the Office of Responsible AI will review the results and decide how to proceed. Document any changes to the Responsible Release Criteria and document the results of evaluation.  RS3.5 Conduct all evaluations tagged as Ongoing Evaluation Checkpoints in other Goals on an ongoing basis. 
RS3.6 If there are targets in Ongoing Evaluation Checkpoints that are no longer satisfied, consult with named reviewers, and in the case of Sensitive Uses, with the Office of Responsible AI, to develop and implement a plan to close any gaps. Document the process, its results, and conclusions. 
RS3.7 If evidence comes to light that refutes the system is fit for purpose for an intended use at any point in the systemﾕs use: 
1. remove the intended use from customer-facing materials and make current customers aware of the issue, take action to close the identified gap, or discontinue the system, 2) revise documentation related to the intended use, and 3) publish the revised documentation to customers. 
When the system is a platform service made available to external customers or partners, include this information in the required Transparency Note.
